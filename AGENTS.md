# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
This is a Gradle multi-module Java repository. Each module lives at the root as `nozdormu-*` and follows the standard layout:
- `src/main/java` for production code
- `src/test/java` for tests
- `build/` is generated by Gradle

Key modules include `nozdormu-common`, `nozdormu-inject`, `nozdormu-interceptor`, `nozdormu-config`, `nozdormu-async`, and decompiler-related modules. Shared configuration is in the root `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`.
Decompiler modules are split into an API core (`nozdormu-decompiler`) and provider implementations (`nozdormu-decompiler-cfr`, `nozdormu-decompiler-vineflower`). When changing decompiler behavior, update the core API first and keep providers in sync.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the Gradle wrapper from the repo root:
- `./gradlew build` to compile all modules and run tests.
- `./gradlew test` to run the full test suite.
- `./gradlew :nozdormu-inject:test` to run tests for a specific module.
- `./gradlew clean` to remove generated outputs.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Code is standard Java with 4-space indentation. Keep packages under `io.nozdormu.*`. Use UpperCamelCase for classes, lowerCamelCase for methods/fields, and ALL_CAPS for constants. No formatter is configured, so preserve existing style in touched files and keep imports organized and minimal.

## Testing Guidelines
Tests use JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5). Test classes follow the `*Test` naming pattern and live under each module’s `src/test/java` (e.g., `nozdormu-async/src/test/java/.../AsyncTest.java`). Run the module-specific tests when changing a single module, and run the full suite before larger changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Commit history favors short, imperative messages such as `Update ProcessorManager.java` or `update`. Keep messages concise and mention the affected module or file when it improves clarity. For pull requests, include a clear description, list any tests run, and call out behavior changes or compatibility impacts.
